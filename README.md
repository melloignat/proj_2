## **Project description:**

Project to analyze apartments sales data to gather incites about parameter affecting item price and how long it will take to sell it. Mentioned parameters later supposed to be used to build an automated system to track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

## **Project timeline:**

* Data was checked for missing values and actions were taken to resolve this issue either by dropping the data or various filling technics.
* Data was checked for duplicates and cleared.
* Data was checked for outliners and cleared.
* New features were generated based on current ones for better prediction.
* Full exploratory data analysis was performed to analyze patterns and provide business incites.
* TTS ("time to sell") dependency from the features was analyzed to find strong correlations.

## **Project result:**

We have identified several features that are critical for "time to sell" parameter and have very big influence on it. Information was given to the marketing team and ML team for price prediction models tuning.
